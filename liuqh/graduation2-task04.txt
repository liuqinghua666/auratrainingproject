（4）任务4
 利用Spark RDD 或Spark DataFrame 分析产生以下结果：
 1、平均日交易额最大的前10 个商家，并输出他们各自的交易额
 2、分别输出北京、上海和广州三个城市最受欢迎的10 家火锅商店编号
    最受欢迎是指以下得分最高：0.7 *(平均评分/5) + 0.3 * (平均消费金额/最高消费金额)
【防雷攻略：
1、在user_info过滤RDD的时候，不要用长度过滤，否则会把shop给过滤掉，这样最终统计出来的店铺就不对了。详见java代码
2、现在Presto中执行SQL，JAVA运行结果与之比对，可以对比统计结果是否一致。上面的问题1就是比对后发现不一致，经过排查发现很多店铺的最后一列数据没有，因此不能被过滤掉。
】
【答案见：“D、最终答案汇总”】


A、先在Presto中执行对应SQL获得结果：
